Toktoken is a Figma plugin designed to streamline the extraction of design tokens defined within your Figma design system.

With Toktoken, you can easily extract tokens for colors and typography and export them into a structured JSON format. This plugin enables designers and developers to maintain consistency across design and development workflows by providing a centralized source of truth for design tokens.

Simply select the desired tokens within your Figma project, and Toktoken will generate a JSON file that can be saved locally or uploaded to your github project repository.

Stay tuned for future updates, as we plan to expand the capabilities to include additional design token types.
